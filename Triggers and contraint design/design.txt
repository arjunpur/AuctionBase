The result of decomposing the given table led me to the creation of 6 tables that
seemingly encapsulate the essence of the data set with minimal redundancy.

The 6 tables and their attributes are:
1) Items(ItemID, Name, Currently, Buy_Price, First_Bid, Number_of_Bids, Started, Ends, Description)
2) Sellers(UserID, Location, Country, Rating)
3) Bidders(UserID, Location, Country, Rating)
4) Bids(UserID, Time, Amount, ItemID)
5) Sales(UserID,ItemID);
5) Categories(ItemID, Category)


This schema is in 4NF. There are several dependencies that existed in the original table 
that aided in the decomposition, such as:
1) ItemID ->-> Category
2) ItemID -> Name, Currently, Buy_Price, First_Bid, Number_Of_Bids, Started, Ends, Description
3) UserID ->-> ItemID
4) UserID -> Location, Country, Rating (for both sellers and bidders)
5) UserID -> Time, Amount

The decomposition follows simply from the above dependencies. We have one table Items that contains all the details
of items present in the database and their info related to their bids. We have the Users tables that has all the info
about sellers and bidders. Bids and Sales are also separate table as per dependencies 5) and 3)
